## ðŸš€ About Me
Hello, my name is [ElGoumri Reda](https://www.github.com/RedaBoi12), and I am the creator of this repository
"SISPOS", which is my second angular project and
is primarily intended to help me learn and understand the framework
as much as possible .


## ðŸ›  Skills
HTML, CSS, jQuery, Javascript, Typescript  
**Frameworks:** Bootstrap, Angular

<br><br><br><br>
## Lessons Learned

**What did you learn while building this project? What challenges did you face and how did you overcome them?**

Long before this project, I had very little knowledge of front end development.
or web development in general, but working on this project, getting errors
and spending so much time looking for fixes is really how a person
learn something.

The most difficult challenge for me in this project was learning how to fully manipulate
an API using http requests and the HttpClient module offered by Angular, whether in
retrieving all the information via a GET request, loading the return into an observable,
by transforming it into an array to move it from one page to another and display the information
correct to the user.   

I also learned how to make a full P.E.N REST Api from scratch, and linked it to my project. Which is really cool!
